I am a Linux kernel developer and a Gentoo developer. I have written patches to
many components of the open source stack. I have [a few patches in the Linux
kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits?author=ryao) with more on the
way. I am [an active contributor to ZFSOnLinux
upstream](https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/commits?author=ryao).

I dislike proprietary software because it makes users dependent on a particular
vendor and I make an effort to ensure that all of my work is available under
open source licenses. I am a fan of individual choice when it comes to
contributing changes and consequently, I prefer non-restrictive open source
licensing like the ISC license. I do my best to honor project licenses whenever
I contribute patches, even when the software is licensed under a license more
restrictive than I would like.
