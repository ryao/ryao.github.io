There have been plenty of changes in the past month of my life. A relative
died, I took a job for [ZFSOnLinux][zfsonlinux] development, I setup this blog
and I have used my leisure time to package pipelight for Gentoo.

People have been wondering about my new job. I started last Monday. The first
thing that my new employer wants me to do is write a blog post on the state of
ZFSOnLinux for the corporate blog, so I am working on that. I want it to
provide people with the information that they need to make their own decisions,
so writing it is taking far longer than I wanted, but I think the result will
be worth the effort.

I have not yet decided if I will mirror the post here. If I do not, I will make
a post with the link. That aside, people have asked me to write blog posts on a
variety of topics. I do not want to get into the habit of posting what my next
post will be, but this is the first post on this blog, so I will make an
exception. I have been asked to write a blog post on the pipelight packaging,
so I will write that (on my own time) once my draft for the State of ZFSOnLinux
post is done.

Until then, my plan is to invest my time into the State of ZFSOnLinux post. It
should clarify many things about ZFSOnLinux that I have wanted to see clarified
for a long time and I am close enough to having it written that I want to see
it finished ASAP. Others might find it strange that I am volunteering my
personal time for work, but it is more than a job to me. It is fun. :)

With that in mind, I am looking forward to my next post(s). If I have Jekyll
setup correctly, people should be able to follow them in their RSS readers.
Also, while I have plenty of topic ideas, feel free to email me with
suggestions on what you would like to see written here. I am always willing to
share knowledge and now that I have Jekyll setup, that will be easier for me to
do than ever. Speaking of which, this entire blog is open source and you can
view [the blog's source code on github][blog-github].

Lastly, some might be wondering about my choice of title. It is a parody of
"Deus dixitque fiat lux". That is perhaps the most famous phrase of all time.
Parodying it seemed appropriate for a first post.
